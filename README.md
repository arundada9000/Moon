How to update it to your liking.
To add an image you want, go inside assets and paste the image, then delete existing image1.jpg file and rename your new image to image1.jpg.

same for music, paste your music inside assets and then delete the existing music.mp3 and rename your music to music,mp3

to add new lines when hovered , go at the bottom inside index.html , inside script tag there you can see const phrases = ["",""] like this, just update the text without changing anything else, you can remove or add more lines.

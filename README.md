### 💬 Update Hover Text

![Edit Text](./preview/hover-text.png)

At the bottom of the `index.html` file, find this code inside the `<script>` tag:

```js
const phrases = ["", ""];
```

You can:

- Replace the text inside the quotes with your own lines.

- Add more phrases by separating them with commas.

- Or remove lines if you want fewer hover messages.

### 🪶 Example:

```js
const phrases = ["To the moon 🚀", "Shine bright 🌕", "Keep dreaming 💫"];
```
